# jsPsych Assignment #2: Reaction Time Experiments & 'Hello World' Tutorial

## **Reaction Time Experiment (jsPsych Tutorial):**

This is a simple reaction time experiment that manipulates:

(1) the duration of fixation trials, and

(2) the colour of circle stimuli

to see how they affect the reaction times of participants to said
stimuli, as well as the accuracy of their responses.

**Components of this experiment:**

(1) Welcome message

(2) Instructions for participants

(3) Trials for the experiment (10 trials total)

(4) Debrief (informs participants on their accuracy, in %, as well
    as average reaction time, in ms)

*Note:* The file for this experiment, entitled
'reactionTimeExperiment.html' can be found through the following pathway

\> MyExperiment \> reactionTimeExperiment.html

## **Modified Reaction Time Experiment (myNewExperiment.html):**

This is a reaction time experiment that manipulates:

(1) the shape/colour of the visual stimulus, and

(2) the duration of fixation trials

to see how they affect the reaction times of participants to said
stimuli, as well as the accuracy of their responses.

**Components of this experiment:**

(1) Welcome message

(2) Instructions for participants

(3) Trials for the experiment (10 trials total)

(4) Debrief (informs participants on their accuracy, in %, and average
reaction time, in ms, for blue squares vs. orange circles, as well as
their difference in reaction time for blue square trials vs. orange
circle trials).

can be found through the following pathway -- maghamShreiya \>

## **'Hello World' Tutorial:**

The 'Hello World' tutorial file, when run, produces a message that reads
'Hello World!' This message disappears when the participant presses a
key on their keyboard.

*Note:* the file for this experiment, entitled 'experiment.html' can be
found through the following pathway -- maghamShreiya \>

## **Other Folders and Files in the 'MyExperiment' Folder within the 'maghamShreiya' Repository:**

(1) *img*: This folder contains the stimulus images for the two
    reaction time experiments. It is crucial that the name of this
    folder and the elements within it ('blue.png', 'blueSquare.png',
    'orange.png') remain congruent with the code in the reaction time
    experiment files (myNewExperiment.html,
    reactionTimeExperiment.html). This folder must be downloaded prior
    to running either of these two reaction time experiment .html files
    in your web browser.

(2) *jspsych*: This folder contains downloaded/imported jsPsych
    library scripts. Once again it is crucial that the name of this
    folder and the elements within it remain congruent with the code in
    the reaction time experiment files, as well as the hello world
    tutorial file (experiment.html). This folder must be downloaded
    prior to running any of the three .html files.

(3) *README.md*: Lastly, there is this README.md file that you're
    currently viewing. This file helps viewers understand the critical
    elements to making the code for the 3 aforementioned .html files
    run.

## **Steps for Running and/or Viewing the Code for the Three Experiments:**

(1) Download all the files and folders necessary (see above) to your
    local computer. This includes **ALL** of the contents within the
    'MyExperiments' folder (access this folder through the pathway
    'maghamShreiya \> Magham_Shreiya_assignments \> JsPsych_2_assignment
    \> MyExperiment'). Alternatively, you can clone the entire
    repository (maghamShreiya) to your local computer using the 'git
    clone' function.

(2) Click on the .html file(s) you'd like to run. The experiment
    will open up in your web browser.

(3) If you'd like to view the code, open the .html file(s) in your
    preferred IDE.
