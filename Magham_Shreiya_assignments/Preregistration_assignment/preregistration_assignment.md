# Study Information 

## 1. Title 

>Interaction Effect Between Eyebrow Diagonality and Cartoonization of Negative-Affect Facial Image Stimuli on Valence Perception

## 2. Author

>Shreiya Magham

## 3. Description 

>Caricaturization is a versatile, impactful technique for conveying messages in contemporary public spheres—particularly messages relating to persuasion and subversion (Alam et al., 2024). Often the messages in caricaturized pieces convey a negative emotional affect, due to their highly critical and satirical nature (Streicher, 1967, p. 431). The OED defines “caricature” as a “grotesque or ludicrous representation of persons or things by exaggeration of their most characteristic and striking features” (“Caricature (n.),” 2024). It therefore becomes evident that a key aspect of caricatures is their exaggerated natures. Brennan (1985) takes this definition further, specifically in the context of caricatured faces. She notes how the caricaturization of human faces exaggerates only “perceptually-significant” facial features, and is “traditionally executed with few lines,” such as within caricatured cartoon faces (p. 170). One such facial feature, made more salient through caricaturization compared to realistic facial representations, includes the eyebrows (Gao et al., 2003, p. 407). 

>Circling back to earlier, this begs the question as to the extent to which a caricaturist’s exaggeration of specific facial features, such as the eyebrows—impacts the emotional affect that gets perceived from their renderings of faces. Here, affect is defined as a term to describe “feeling states, like emotions and moods,” and involves two dimensions: arousal (emotional intensity of a stimulus) and valence (positivity or negativity of a stimulus) (Niven, 2020; Russell, 1980, p. 1169). This aforementioned question is important to investigate because affective information perception can serve to enhance the messages that caricaturists wish to convey, relative to more realistic representations of facial features. The enhancement of messages could subsequently be extremely powerful and influential (e.g., having an effect on the political opinions of the general public). Interaction effects between the exaggeration of the eyebrows and the “cartoonification” of facial stimuli on the emotional perception of faces have not been looked into yet. However, there has been extensive background literature outlining separate effects of manipulating specific facial features (namely, the mouth and eyes, and less so, the eyebrows), and “cartoonifying” facial stimuli, on perceptions of affect of facial stimuli. This research provides the background underpinning my proposed exploration.

>Firstly, emotional perception literature has extensively discussed the effect of manipulating specific facial features on perceptions of valence from a stimulus of a face. Specifically looking at the facial feature of the eyebrows, a study by Aronoff et al. (1992), manipulated the extent to which two diagonal lines pointed downwards and inwards towards each other (i.e., similar to the facial feature of the eyebrows in human faces). The researchers found that there was a “diagonality effect,” where double diagonal lines with a downwards-facing vertex and a smaller angle between them from vertical were perceived as more threatening than diagonal lines with less diagonality (Aronoff et al., 1992, p. 1063). Here, Aronoff’s results suggest that the diagonality of one’s eyebrows would affect participants’ appraisals (positive or negative), ultimately affecting their experience of threat. One of the factors of my study will thus look at how manipulating eyebrow angle (i.e., diagonality) affects the valence perception of a facial stimulus.

>Additionally, relevant literature has detailed the effect of manipulating the stylization of a facial image stimulus on valence perception. For instance, a study by Zhang et al. (2021) found that sad cartoon stimuli were perceived as more intensely “sad” (i.e., more negatively-valenced, given that sadness is a purely negative valence item; Nealis et al., 2016) when compared with realistic facial stimuli. They came to this finding after conducting an experiment where they manipulated real face image stimuli into cartoon representations, and presented these realistic and cartoonized facial stimuli to participants (Zhang et al., 2021). The results of this study indicate that cartoonized negative-affect face stimuli were correlated with more negatively-valenced rating assignments from participants, compared to realistic faces. This relates to the second factor I will manipulate in my study: the cartoonization of facial stimuli.

>Overall, I will investigate the interaction effect between these two factors (eyebrow diagonality and cartoonization of negative-affect facial image stimuli) on the valence perception of said stimuli. Specifically, I will focus on negative-affect facial stimuli due to the nature of the messaging within caricatured works. This investigation has significant implications in terms of the persuasive power or influence of caricaturized works in communicating specific messages.

## 4. Hypotheses 
>H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): There will be an interaction effect between eyebrow diagonality and cartoonization on valence perceptions of negative-affect facial image stimuli.

>Rationale for H1: Given background literature indicating the presence of main effects of each of the two factors on valence perception of negative affect facial stimuli, I predict an "amplification" in negative valence for the condition with the cartoonized facial stimulus and the greatest amount, or "exaggeration," of eyebrow diagonality (i.e., condition "C-45" in the "Manipulated Variables" section).

>H0 (Null Hypothesis): There will not be an interaction effect between eyebrow diagonality and cartoonization on valence perceptions of negative-affect facial image stimuli.

>I also hypothesize this study will replicate prior findings, and that there will be main effects of eyebrow diagonality (factor 1) and cartoonization (factor 2) on the valence perception of negative-affect facial stimuli.

# Design Plan 

## 5. Study type 

>This web-based study will have an experimental design (since the factors will be directly manipulated to observe effects on the dependent variable).

## 6. Blinding 

>No blinding is involved in this study.

## 7. Is there any additional blinding in this study?

>N/A.

## 8. Study design 

>I will use a 2x3, within-subject two-factor design. Diagonality of the eyebrows of negative-affect human facial stimuli will be one of my factors (3 levels: 45 degrees from vertical, 55 degrees from vertical, 65 degrees from vertical), and the cartoonization of the facial stimuli will be another factor (2 levels: realistic and cartoonized).

>First, negative-affect realistic facial images will be obtained from the open-source image database "OASIS" (Open Affective Standard Image Set) created by Kurdi et al. (2017). While the OASIS database contains images containing a vast variety of affective images, I will filter out only the images tagged with the words "face" in addition to negative-valence words (i.e., "sad," "scared," "angry," "bored," "depressed," and "miserable"). These negative-valence words were selected with reference to Russell (1980)'s circumplex model of affect. The resulting image set of negative-affect realistic facial images from the OASIS database has a size of n = 24 images.

>All of these selected negative-affect realistic facial images will then be manipulated in 6 different ways (given the 2x3 design, there are 6 conditions; see [16. Manipulated variables](#16-manipulated-variables)). I will cartoonize all the obtained facial images in Adobe Photoshop to create cartoonized facial stimuli. Additionally, I will edit the eyebrow diagonilities for each of the resulting realistic and cartoonized facial stimuli (45 degrees from vertical, 55 degrees from vertical, 65 degrees from vertical) to create the negative-affect facial image stimuli from each of the 6 conditions. In total, there will be n = 24 negative-affect facial image stimuli in each condition, and 144 stimuli in total.

>These negative-affect facial stimuli will be presented to participants in a web-based experiment. All participants will view a welcome and instructions page, followed by a consent page, and seriousness check. Then, participants will have 6 blocks of trials, with each block containing 24 trials. This blocking of trials will be done to control for fatigue effects. For each trial, participants will rate each of the negative-affect facial stimuli on their perceived valence of the image, on a scale from 1-7 (similar to the scale used for the original OASIS database). A Latin square design to control for order effects in this study. 

>Following the completion of each of the 6 blocks of trials, participants will be able to view a debrief screen, and will be thanked for their participation in the study.

## 9. Randomization 

>A Latin square design will be used to randomize the trials, since the experiment has a within-participants design. This will control for any order effects.

# Sampling Plan 

## 10. Existing data 

>Registration prior to accessing the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist, but have not been accessed by you or your collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by another researcher or institution.

## 11. Explanation of existing data 

>In this study, while I have not yet collected data relevant to the study (since the pre-registration was done before any data collection), there is pre-existing data from the OASIS researchers about the valence and arousal ground-truth ratings of images (Kurdi et al., 2017). I have not looked at these ground-truth ratings, and do not plan to use these ratings for my study. However, I will be using Kurdi et al. (2017)'s categorizations of images as "faces" and words indicating negative valence (as per the circumplex model).

## 12. Data collection procedures 

> Data collection will all be done through Amazon's MTurk (including the recruitment of participants and conducting the experiment). The participants will do the study in their preferred web browser.

## 13. Sample size 

> The sample size for this study will be 100 participants.

## 14. Sample size rationale 

> The sample size I will use for this study is based on sample sizes from similar relevant studies (i.e., Cerda et al. (2021) used 83 participants). 

## 15. Stopping rule 

>Data collection will be stopped at 100 participants, or by April 8, 2025.

# Variables 

## 16. Manipulated variables 

>Manipulated variables:

(1) *IV 1* (cartoonization of the negative-affect facial stimuli) will have 2 levels (2 levels: realistic or "R", cartoonized or "C")

(2) *IV 2* (eyebrow diagonality from vertical) will be my second factor (3 levels: 45 degrees from vertical, 55 degrees from vertical, 65 degrees from vertical).

>Conditions:

(1) R-45

(2) R-55

(3) R-65

(4) C-45

(5) C-55

(6) C-65


## 17. Measured variables 

> For each trial, a single dependent variable of valence perception of the negative-affect facial stimuli will be measured on a scale from 1-7 (with "1" being extremely negative valence, and "7" being extremely positive in valence).

## 18. Indices 

>The mean will be taken for each of the 6 conditions in order to visualize the data. Since the factorial two-way ANOVA will not be done manually, indexing is only needed for data visualization.

# Analysis Plan 

## 19. Statistical models 

> I will use a 2x3 factorial rmANOVA to find the interaction effects between the two factors, as well as main effects of each factor, on the dependent variable.

## 20. Transformations 

> The obtained data will not require require any additional transformations.

## 21. Inference criteria 

> I will use the standard p\<.05 criteria for determining if the rmANOVA and the post-hoc tests suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if H0 were correct. I will use Fisher's LSD (least significant differences) as my post-hoc test to reduce type I errors. I will use omega-squared to find the effect sizes for comparisons.

## 22. Data exclusion 

> All data will be included in the analysis. 

## 23. Missing data 

> No missing data is expected, due to the mandatory nature of each of the experiment's trials.

## 24. Exploratory analysis 

> N/A.
