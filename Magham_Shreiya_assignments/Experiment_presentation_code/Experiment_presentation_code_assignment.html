    negative or positive they are. The experiment is expected to take <10 minutes

    <p><strong>Potential Risks:</strong> The risks associated with participating in 
    this study are minimal. If you feel uncomfortable at any point during your participation,

      <p>Exaggarated features and cartoonization are key components of the artistic technique of <strong>caricaturization</strong>. It is important that we better understand the 
      effect of caricaturization on our perception of emotion because caricaturization
      is used for conveying influential messages (such as in the case of political cartoons). 
      Since caricaturization is often used to convey messages that are negative in 
      nature, we manipulated the eyebrow angles and cartoonization of negative faces.

      our research.</p></div>`
