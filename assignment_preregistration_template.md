# Study Information

Effect of manipulating eyebrow angle and caricaturization of negative affect human face stimuli on valence perception.

## 2. Author

## 3. Description 

Caricaturing is a versatile, impactful cartooning technique for conveying messages in contemporary public spheres—particularly messages relating to persuasion, subversion, and more (Alam et al., 2024). The overwhelming majority of caricatures are highly satirical and critical, and hence are often negative in affect (Streicher, 1967, p. 431). 

Before delving any further into how caricaturization facilitates the intended messaging from caricaturists though, it is important to define the term “caricature” to establish an exactness. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “caricature” as a “grotesque or ludicrous representation of persons or things by exaggeration of their most characteristic and striking features” (“Caricature (n.),” 2024). Brennan (1985) specifically notes how the caricaturization of human faces exaggerates only “perceptually-significant” facial features, and is “traditionally executed with few lines” (p. 170). One such facial feature, made more salient through caricaturization compared to realistic facial representations, includes the eyebrows (Gao et al., 2003, p. 407). Circling back to earlier, this begs the question as to how exactly a caricaturist’s exaggeration of specific facial features—such as the eyebrows—enhances messages they wish to convey, relative to more realistic representations of facial features? This is where visual perception of emotion in faces comes into play. 

Firstly, emotional perception literature has extensively discussed the effect of manipulating specific facial features on perceptions of valence (and affect more broadly) in human faces. Here, affect is defined as being used as a term to describe “feeling states, like emotions and moods” and involves two dimensions: arousal (emotional intensity) and valence (which describes the positivity or negativity towards a stimulus (Niven, 2020; Russell, 1980, p. 1169). Specifically looking at the facial feature of the eyebrows, a study by Aronoff et al. (1992), manipulated the extent to which two diagonal lines pointed downwards and inwards towards each other (i.e., similar to the facial feature of the eyebrows in human faces). The researcher found that that there was a diagonality effect, where double diagonal lines with a downwards-facing vertex and a smaller angle between them from vertical were perceived as more threatening than diagonal lines with less diagonality; negative appraisal (valence) underpinned threat perception (Aronoff et al., 1992, p. 1063).

Emotional perception literature has also detailed the effect of manipulating the level of stylization of a facial image stimulus on valence perception. For instance, a study by Cerda et al. (2021) manipulated the type of face stimulus (i.e., human, avatar, mesh, robot), as well as affect (i.e., positive or negative) to see how it would affect participants categorization of positive or negative valence emotions. They found that the number of correct responses (i.e., valence categorizations) were actually similar for humans and avatars stimuli, while for the other two stimuli, emotion recognition ability decreased significantly (Cerda et al., 2020). 

The focus of this study will be addressing the gap in the pre-existing emotional perception literature in manipulating the extent to which facial features (specifically the eyebrows, in number of degrees tilted inwards) are exaggerated, and observing how this interacts with a more caricatured representation of a human face specifically, in affecting valence perception. Drawing from the affect-as-information hypothesis described by Clore et al. (2001), the presence of such effect would carry important implications in terms of the persuasive power of caricatured works in communicating specific messages.

## 4. Hypotheses 

I hypothesize that there will be an interaction effect between caricaturization of faces and eyebrow angle on valence perception of negative affect facial stimuli. I also hypothesize that there will be main effects of caricaturization of the faces (factor 1) and eyebrow angle (factor 2) on valence perception of negative affect facial stimuli. 

# Design Plan 

## 5. Study type 

This study will be an online experimental study (independent variables/factors will be manipulated directly).

## 6. Blinding 
No blinding is involved in this study.

## 7. Is there any additional blinding in this study? 
N/A.

## 8. Study design 

I will use a 2x3 within-subject factorial design with caricaturization of negative valence human facial stimuli will be my first factor (2 levels: realistic, caricaturized), and the eyebrows' downwards diagonal angle from vertical will be my second factor (3 levels: 20 deg, 25 deg, 30 deg). For the manipulation of the first factor, negative valence realistic facial stimuli will be obtained from the open-source OASIS (Open Affective Standard Image Set) image database created by Kurdi et al. (2017). Using Adobe Photoshop, I will then caricaturize all the negative valence facial stimuli to be caricaturized. Similarly, I will use Adobe Photoshop to manipulate the angles of the eyebrows from diagonal (i.e., factor 2). I will use a Latin square design to control for order effects. Participants will be asked to rate valence on a scale from 1-7 (similar to the scale used for the original OASIS database to compare the study results to the ground truth valence scores in the original OASIS image dataset).

## 9. Randomization 

The Latin square will be used for randomization of the trials, since the experiment has a within-participant design.

# Sampling Plan 

## 10. Existing data 

Registration prior to accessing the data: As of the date of submission, the data exist, but have not been accessed by you or your collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by another researcher or institution. 

## 11. Explanation of existing data 

In this study, while I have not yet collected data relevant to the study (since the pre-registration was done before any data collection), there is pre-existing data from the OASIS researchers about the valence and arousal of images. However, I have not looked at these ground-truth ratings, and do not plan to use these ratings for my study. However, I will be using researcher categorizations of images as "faces" and words indicating negative valence (as per the circumplex model), such as "depressed," "sad," "scared," etc.

## 12. Data collection procedures 

Data collection will all be done through Amazon's MTurk (including the recruitment of participants and conducting the experiment). The participants can do the study in their preferred web browser.

## 13. Sample size 

Sample size for this study will be 100 participants.

## 14. Sample size rationale 

Based on sample sizes from similar relevant studies (i.e., Cerda et al. (2021) used 83 participants). 

## 15. Stopping rule 

Data collection will be stopped at 100 participants, or by April 8, 2025.

# Variables 

## 16. Manipulated variables 

Manipulated variables:
(1) IV 1 (level of caricaturization of the negative affect human face stimuli) will have 2 levels (2 levels: realistic or "R", caricaturized or "C")
(2) IV 2 (eyebrows' downwards diagonal angle from vertical) will be my second factor (3 levels: 20 deg, 25 deg, 30 deg).

Conditions:
(1) R-20
(2) R-25
(3) R-30
(4) C-20
(5) C-25


## 17. Measured variables 

For each trial, a single dependent variable of valence perception will be measured on a scale from 1-7 (with "1" being extremely negative valence, and "7" being extremely positive in valence).

## 18. Indices 

The mean will be taken for each of the 6 conditions in order to be able to visualize the data. Since the factorial two-way ANOVA will not be done manually, the indexing is really only be needed for data visualization.

# Analysis Plan 

## 19. Statistical models 

I will use a 2x3 factorial rmANOVA to find the interaction effects between the two factors, as well as main effects of each factor, on the dependent variable.

## 20. Transformations 

There obtained data will not require require any additional transformations.

## 21. Inference criteria 

I will use the standard p\<.05 criteria for determining if the ANOVA and the post-hoc test suggest that the results are significantly different from those expected if the null hypothesis were correct. I will use the Fisher's LSD (least significant differences) to reduce type I errors. I will use omega-squared for finding the effect sizes for comparisons.

## 22. Data exclusion 

All data will be included in the analysis. 


## 23. Missing data 

No missing data is expected.

## 24. Exploratory analysis 

N/A.
